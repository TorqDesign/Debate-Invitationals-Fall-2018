                 <h3>Reputation: A City of Innovations </h3>
                 <p>Alex is an innovator, who has patent to his credit. He can contribute  to developing Windsor as a city, which is innovator friendly, where new enterprises can be set up easily and are supported in every way and where the City Hall is agile in creating bye-laws and new policies for new technologies.</p>
                 <h3>Reduce Property Tax Rates</h3>
                 <p style="text-align:center; display:block;">Tax rates in Windsor are second highest in Ontario.</p>
                 <h5>Residential Property Tax Rates in Windsor are higher than the rates in  smaller (e.g. Lakshore, LaSalle) or larger (e,g, Toronto) or smaller or similarly sized cities (e.g Hamilton).</h5></p>
                 <p>In spite of the high rates, the city is not able to provide the good services to the residents such as sewage, public transport, roads, public internet and public libraries.</p>
                 <p>PLEASE NOTE: </p>
                 <p>Even without any increase in Property Tax Rate (% or mil) the dollar amount of Property Tax is going to  increase substantially due to increase in property prices in the last two years. Therefore, the taxes will cut into the available funds for families.  </p>
                 <p>The Development Charges to partially pay for the initial costs of providing sewage and water connected are paid when a property is first developed is one of the highest in region in Windsor - 60% to 300% higher than our neighbors e,g, Kingsville, LaSalle (Ref Reference: Report by Brian Cross in Windsor Star, dated 19th June 2018 (page A3)) </p>
                 <h3> Example of Residential Tax Rates </h3>
                 <div class="platform-center">
                    <p>For single-family homes in the region around Windsor: </p>
                    <p>48.62% higher as compared with the rate at Lakeshore; <br>
                        42.93% higher as compared with the rate at Kingsville;<br>
                        36.30% higher as compared with the rate at Tecumseh;<br>	
                        22.73% higher as compared with the rate at Township of Pelee;<br>
                        22.08% higher as compared with the rate at Essex;<br>
                        19.47% higher as compared with the rate at Lasalle;<br>
                        18.37% higher as compared with the rate at Amherstburg;<br>
                    2.74% higher as compared with the rate at Leamington.</p>
                    <p>For single-family homes in two other cities in Ontario:</p>
                    <p>Tax Rate at Windsor is<br>
                        46.63% higher as compared with the rate at Hamilton,<br>
                        64.93% higher as compared with the rate at Brampton.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>Note: For the above calculation, Lakeshore  is used as a common reference of the Tax Rate for easy comparison:<br>
                    %age higher  =   (Tax Rate at Windsor â€“ Tax Rate at _____ (city))/ (Tax Rate at Lakeshore)</p>
                    <p>Not only residential property is high - Business owners in my Ward 9 are complaining to me about high taxes of tune of 40 to 60% of the rates compared to neighboring towns.</p>
                    <p>High tax rates are negatively affecting our local businesses, fellow Windsorites, and our city as a whole. High tax rates make businesses noncompetitive. Furthermore, they drive high-end housing to nearby cities, thereby depriving the city of income while saddling it with providing services to those who come to the city during the day. </p>

                <h3>Detailed Calculations And References</h3>
                <p>1.Reference FOR CITIES/Towns in the region: 2017 REALTOR Tax Rates<br>
                    2.** Since the rates may differ from area to area in a city, the highest rates for Residential properties have been chosen as the most conservative basis of comparison with Windsor. e.g. For Essex, the rates for Ward 1, where the rates are the highest, have been selected for comparison with Windsor.<br>
                    3.For Brampton, the Residential Taxable (full rate, shared PIL) has been used (http://www.brampton.ca/EN/residents/Taxes-Assessment/taxation/Pages/Tax-Rates.aspx ).<br>
                    4.For Hamilton, the rates in Hamilton Urban are chosen (https://d3fpllf1m7bbt3.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/media/browser/2018-06-19/2018-residential-tax-rates.pdf ).<br>

                <h3> Fix Infrastructure </h3>
                <p>Sewage backup & flooding:<p>
                   <p>Many homes and businesses have suffered from the issue of sewage back up and flooding. This leads to issues of losses as well as problems of increased insurance charges.<br>
                       Even though families and business suffer the losses, the major problem is inadequate facility for flow of water under heavy down pours. So the SOLUTION lies  with the engineering department of the city.<br>
                   Besides financial losses, senior citizens suffer psychological issues when they lose things which have sentimental value.</p> 
                   <p>Public Transport:</p>
                   <p>Public transport & services: Since 1990s, Tokyo city provides information about the distance and the time of arrival of buses at Bus Stops. Today with the availability of mobile technologies and Global Locational technologies, through use of geo-synchronous computers, it is easy to provide excellent services to Windsorite. It only requires a vision, an understanding of technologies and a determination of making Windsor the best city to live in.<br>
                       Reducing the need for private  cars: By using today's technologies it is possible to make public transport more convenient for users. Moreover, these can make the lives of senior citizens more comfortable.<br>
                   Higher frequency and wider reach of public transit is required so that citizens start using it as their primary means of transport.</p>
                   <p>Better lights in streets for better safety</p>
                   <p>Internal Connectivity:</p>
                   <p>The city has to have good connectivity through continuously up-graded road networks and traffic signals  so that bottlenecks and long lines during rush hours can be avoided.<br>
                   There is a need for ensuring that the streets are well managed to eliminate pockets where rain water accumulates. </p>
                   <h3> Control Electricity, Water and Sewage charges </h3>
                   <p>Electricity, water, and sewage are basic facilities that should be made available to every Windsorite at reasonable rates. Unfortunately, during the last few years these costs have increased because of inefficient public management systems, not because the intrinsic costs have gone up or because availability of energy or water has become scarce. If the managements in the city is focused on providing these services at reasonable costs, it CAN.</p>
                   <p>By using his technical education and management experience, Alex Aggarwal can help the City develop innovative strategies and harness new technologies to see that the city has an excellent infra-structure, in which the citizens can take pride.</p>
                   <h3>Provide Facilities for Families</h3>
                   <p>Ward 9 suffers from lack of a library, community center and other facilities for families. With the help of technology, the library facilities can be augmented by addition of access to some of the facilities through Internet. This will be particularly useful to senior citizens.<br>
                    Facilities for families like the library, community center  etc should be provided at the earliest. <br>
                Somehow the Officers and the Council have forgotten to provide these facilities in Ward 9. Alex will work at the City Hall to have the budget allocated for creation of these facilities.</p>
                <h3>Attract High-Tech Businesses for High Paying Jobs through Agile & Targeted Support</h3>
                <p>Standard Manufacturing is moving to low cost producers such as Mexico and China from Windsor. It is not a question if it move out to low cost countries but when. As a result Windsor has to develop diverse economy of  high tech such as self driving vehicles, 3D printing and high tech can provide , health sciences such as biotech and genetic engineering is way for Windsor to bring high tech jobs to Windsor. As well as do innovation using technology to increase productivity and quality to produce goods at very competitive prices.</p>
                <p>Windsor is considered a Car Manufacturing capital of Canada - as result we should lead in self driving by doing following things which require very no or very low investments. </p>
                â€‹				<p>Changing city by laws to all driverless vehicles to drive on the Windsor city - This is create incentive for GM, Google and Uber and other vendors to test on Windsor Roads. e.g. Right now Phoenix in Arizona is one of very few cities allows driverless vehicle on their and as result significant Self driving  development of autonomous cars is happening . As a result Google, GM, many others are testing their vehicles in Phoenix leading to developing high tech talent in Phoenix. AZ.</p>
                <p>Declare open award for buying 100 self driving snow plow pickup truck from companies who develop in Windsor.</p>
                <p>Declare a Chair in University of Windsor to get best professor/researcher in Self driving technology in the world</p>
                <p>Encourage Local business especially high tech providers by giving preference in City purchasing.</p>
                <p>A successful industry for production of autonomous snow plow trucks in Windsor can bring together a group of research engineers and such a group may be able to attract others to invest in Windsor in similar other enterprises. Every such successful project can bring tens of high paying jobs to Windsor, without incurring additional high costs to the City.</p>
                <p>The City should attempt to develop a reputation as the most startup-friendly place of the region through providing office and working space at reasonable rates near the city center and through actively providing targeted support for those working on new ideas, projects, businesses andndustries.</p>
                <p>Alex has exactly the kind of experience, which can help the Council develop and execute the policies, required to bring high-paying new jobs to Windsor.</p>
                <p>NOTE: Coordination does not mean taking over or adding the city to the process of research at the university or of trespassing into the field of work of the Windsor Accelerator  or the Windsor Essex Small Business Centre.</p>
                <p>When it is done by knowledgeable person, with experience in consulting engineering and with the objective of economic development of the city, many new doors open up with every success.</p>
                <h3>Make City Hall Agile and Responsive to Residents' Concerns</h3>
                <p>The City Hall must use IT to make it easy for the residents to voice their concerns and to be informed about the progress at the City Hall in redressing the concerns.</p>
                <p>Besides being agile in responding to the residentsâ€™ concerns, the city requires to bring greater coherence to its policies.</p>
                <p>Bring greater coherence to cityâ€™s policies.</p>
                <p>EXAMPLES:</p>
                <p> (i) The City brands itself as Gateway to USAâ€”but has no strategy to remove friction, of long delays and expensive toll charges, in cross-border movement. In a few years, the new Gordie Howe International Bridge should reduce traffic. Meanwhile both the Tunnel and the Ambassador Bridge can support much higher traffic if more immigration booths are opened and are manned at the peak time.   In Windsor, Ward 9 has one of the highest number of people working across the border. as there are no high paying jobs in Windsor.  Each commuter is paying $10(app) bridge/Tunnel Toll daily  non-tax non-deducible expense besides gas and car wear tear. As a result, people move permanently stay across the border. Also high toll rates and traffic has also effected business across the border.</p>
                <p> (ii) The City is the retirement home for Canada. But it lacks  facilities adequate geriatric clinics  for seniors, hospital beds and adequate public transport for physically challenged. </p>
                <p>In short Windsor City requires agility and a coherent strategy in its policy regime to develop Windsor into a prosperous city. Alex Aggarwal can contribute to developing, sustaining and executing such a strategy due to his education and management consulting experience.</p>
                <h3>MEDICAL TEACHING HOSPITAL & PROVIDING SPECIALITY CARE AT THE  MEGA HOSPITAL</h3>
                <p>Out-of-box thinking could have provided to the city the Mega Hospital, along with other facilities, without incurring the loss of hospitals in the core of the city.</p>
                <p>The new Mega Hospital should have been used to help the university to convert the medical college from a local campus of the London College to an independent medical college of University of Windsor, with facilities, of use to Windsor and the whole of the region of North America.</p>
                <p>Reputed Super-speciality Centers are normally associated with Medical Colleges. If the University could develop the Mega Hospitals as a full-fledged university health care and research institution, the management of the two hospitals in the core of the city, might have found ways of retaining the existing facilities in the core of the city.</p>
                <p>Besides other areas of research of interest to the university and its Professors, the development of the following would be appropriate for Windsor and would be of use to the entire region:</p>
                <p>Center for Geriatric Care and Research</p>
                <p>Center for Ocular Care and Research.</p>
                <p>Alex supports the Mega Hospital and can work at the City Council to  develop innovative ways of progress for the City.</p>
